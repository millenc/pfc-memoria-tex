  abstract = {The multi-purpose integrated homeland surveillance security systems
	are usually located in remote areas. Intelligent decision making
	(IDM) capability emerges as the primary feature in the realization
	of the T/R architecture. The aim of employing IDM is two-fold. First
	is to save energy, as the system operation is desired to be autonomous
	based on the available solar power and the corresponding battery-bank.
	Second is to activate the necessary action(s) required based on the
	pre-defined sensitivity levels. The current work is focused on the
	second aim using the pre-defined sensitivity levels. We propose to
	use a wireless sensor network (WSN) for data harvesting to be used
	as raw input data into our control system. Fire detection has been
	chosen to illustrate the IDM capability of the system. A Fuzzy Logic
	algorithm is developed using five membership functions as temperature,
	smoke, light, humidity and distance. Simulation results for the probability
	of fire based on the fuzzy rules using the status of the membership
	functions are presented in the paper.},
